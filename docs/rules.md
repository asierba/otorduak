# Meal Planning Rules

Every meal slot in the week has a specific type of food assigned to it. No slot is left open to "anything goes" — each one has a clear rule.

## Weekly Schedule

## Notes

- Some meals can appear in more than one category. For example, tortilla + salmorejo counts as both a weekday dinner and TV food, so it can show up on Monday dinner or Friday/Saturday/Sunday dinner.
- Each meal is only used once per week — no repeats.
